## ========
Version 1.1

New functions:
  - wtable(): works as table() but allows weights and shows NAs as default
  - prop.wtable(): works as prop.table() but allows weights and shows NAs as default

Changes in existing functions:
  - multiMCA(): RV computation is now an option, with FALSE as default,
    which makes the function execute faster

Bug fixes:
  - textvarsup(): there was an error with the supplementary 
    variable labels when resmca was of class "csMCA".

Error fixes:
  - textvarsup(): plots supplementary variables on the cloud of categories (and not
    the cloud of individuals as it was mentioned in help).
